# NFL Spread League - GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository named `nfl_spread_league`
2. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
3. Don't initialize with README (since you already have files)

### 2. Push Your Code
```bash
# From the root directory (/Users/jacob/nfl_spread_league)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: NFL spread league app"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nfl_spread_league.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Update Homepage URL
Edit `nfl-pickem/package.json` and replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username:
```json
"homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/nfl_spread_league"
```

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
cd nfl-pickem
npm run deploy
```

### 5. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

Your app will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/nfl_spread_league`

## Updating Your App

After making changes:
```bash
cd nfl-pickem
npm run deploy
```

## Important Notes

- The app expects the CSV file (`nfl_lines_week.csv`) to be in the `public/` folder
- Make sure to run your Python script to generate fresh odds data before deploying
- The app is configured to work with the subdirectory structure of GitHub Pages

## File Structure for GitHub Pages
```
nfl_spread_league/
├── nfl-pickem/          # React app
│   ├── public/
│   │   └── nfl_lines_week.csv  # Odds data
│   └── build/           # Generated by npm run build
├── script.py            # Python odds fetcher
└── nfl_lines_week.csv   # Root CSV (copy to public/)
```
